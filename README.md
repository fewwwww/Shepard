During Covid-19, I come up with the idea of making a device that can allow people to press the button without actually touching them.
I choose to first apply it on the elevator buttons, because, believe it or not, the number of bacteria present on an elevator button is almost 40 times higher than on a public toilet seat.

To get optimal accuracy and privacy, I choose to combine DTMF technology in it. That means you can press the numbers on your phone to tell the elevator your intended floor. 
The device's job is to collect the DTMF frequencies generated by phone, decode the DTMF frequency, then get the numbers and send the signal to the elevator.
The device is based on STM32F103. For the sound detection module, I use LM386. For the decoding module, I use MT8870 chip.

The files uploaded are some of the codes that require coders to modify, so that functions will be completed. To open this project, you need to use KEIL5, and click on the Robot.uvprojx file. Some of the codes of the project are not uploaded, because they are configuration files of the STM32.

*In ShowMeYourFloor branch, there is a application that allows detected numbers to show on your PC when you plug the device with PC.
 !!!You may need to change port number inside the code of Form1 so that your device can be connected.!!!
